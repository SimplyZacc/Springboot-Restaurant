# Springboot-Restaurant-App

[Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) Restaurant app.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. 

One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.example.restauran.RestaurantApplication` class.

Another way would be to use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like this in the command line:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
